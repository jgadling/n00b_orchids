The total n00b's cheat sheet to orchids for terrariums

A friend of mine is setting up their first small vivarium and  asked for suggestions on orchids that would be good for a beginner with a typical int/warm tank. I thought I'd share what I sent them

List #1: Shut up and buy these
--
These plants are bulletproof, they're small enough to fit in ANY sized tank, they're not especially expensive or difficult to find, and they bloom easily. Start with a few of these beauties to a feel for orchid growing. None of the plants on this list like to dry out but they can all handle an occasional mistake.

###Pleurothallis rubella
This everblooming plant grows quickly, and is constantly covered in a halo of bright yellow flowers.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |

|  High | Moist |  2"  |   Warm  | Always |

###Lepanthopsis astrophora
This plant regularly produces clouds of tiny perfect purple flowers. It should be fertilized weekly to encourage flowering. It produces keikis frequently so it will spread across whatever mount or container it's kept in so long as there's moisture.
  
| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  High | Moist |  2"  |   Int/Warm/Hot  | Frequently |

###Scaphosepalum rapax
The leaves measure about 1" and the plant is constantly covered in 3" flower spikes. It has a slightly creeping habit as well and will cover a mount or container over time. The flowers are shaped like little vipers!

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Med/Low | Moist |  1"  |  Warm/Hot | Always |

###Stelis mystax
This is often labeled Pleurothallis mystax, lots of three-pointed blooms emerge from a plant with paddle shaped leaves.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Med/Low | Moist |  3"  | Cool/Int/Warm | Frequently |

###Salpistele brunnea
This tiny plant produces pendant spikes of very elaborate cross shaped flowers. It's a fast grower and very tolerant of beginner mistakes.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Med/Low | Moist |  1"  | Warm | Frequently |

###Haraella retrocalla
Relatively HUGE fuzzy blooms on a small, single-stemmed plant.

List #2: So you have a little bit of experience?
--
These plants are also great for fairly new growers, but may not be for everyone due to more demanding care requirements, size, or cost.

###Pleurothallis quadricaudata
1.5" leaves on 4" stems produce absolutely huge white blooms about 2.5" high. Easy to grow and affordable, but a little too large for the smallest vivs.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  High | Moist |  5"  | Warm | Always |

###Pleurothallis amphigya
1.5" leaves on 4" stems (the foliage is nearly identical to P. quadricaudata above) constantly churn out 1.25" deep purple flowers. Easy to grow, but a little too large for the smallest vivs.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Med | Moist |  5"  | Cool | Always |

###Lepanthes telipogoniflora
This one has it all. Huge bright orange bloom on a tiny plant that's relatively easy to grow. However it is NOT at all tolerant of drying out, it REALLY needs to be in low light (the leaves should stay green, not purple) and it comes with a hefty price tag. 

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Shade | NEVER let dry |  1"  | Warm | Frequently |

###Lepanthes saltatrix
Heart-shaped variegated leaves about 1" across on 3" stems are constantly in bloom. Like many lepanthes, it doesn't like to dry out, it can be tricky to find, and a bit pricey.

| Light |     Water     | Size | Climate | Bloom |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Low | Moist |  4"  | Warm | Always |
